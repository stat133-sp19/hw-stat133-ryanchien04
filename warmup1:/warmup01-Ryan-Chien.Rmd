## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Euclidean Distance

## Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points __p__ and __q__ is the length of the line segement connecting them (\overline{pq}). 

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = \((p_1, p_2, ...., p_n)\) and **q** = \((q_1, q_2, ...., q_n)\) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula.

$$d(p, q) = d(q, p) = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + ... + (q_n - p_n)^2}$$

$$ = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.

$$ ||p|| \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_n^2} = \sqrt{p \cdot p},$$

where the last expression involes the dot product.
